# 3D Printing

![3D Printer](/assets/images/3D_printer.png){: .center-image}
*I use a Creality Ender3 S1 Pro fused deposition modeling printer for print prototyping.*

A current print project I am working on is creating a series of rings based on personal design models.

I use AutoCAD Fusion 360 to complete the models.

Above is the first model and below is the picture of the subsequent print.

A tad small. Back to modeling in larger dimensions.

## Process

After creating the model, I export a model to an .stl file format. At this point, I import the .stl file to a Cura slicing software. This software is where I configure print machine settings specific to materials (i.e. ABS, PLA, PETG, TPU, Wood, etc.) and temperatures which are based on machine capabilities.

I have yet to use wood. PETG (Polyethylene terephthalate glycol) is food safe. TPU (Thermoplastic polyurethane) is by far my favorite since it produces objects which can achieve elastic deformations.
