Process of Jewelry Creation
===========================

Through the use of 3D printing technology, I started to learn about the process of jewlery making. I sat in on a course offered by ODU's art department "Jewelrymaking".

Self directed research uncovered jewelry making with precious metals is an intricate process. It is a form of art. 

This has not detered my efforts.  I recognized FDM printing is does not produce appropriate models for use in later stages of jewelrymaking. This lead to a purchase of a new tool.

Yet to be used, I added a Creality Halot One resin printer. Resin printers are capable of producing significantly more detailed prints and printing mediums which removes the presence of layering.

Resin printing is an extremely intricate process and requires several other tools, personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilation, workspace expansion, and UV curing and washing capabilities is additional processing unique to resin printing.
