A current print project I am working is creating a series of rings based on personal design models.

I use AutoCAD Fusion 360 to complete the models.

Above is the first model and below is the picture of the subsequent print.

A tad small. Back to modeling in larger dimensions.

After creating the model, I export a model in a .stl file format.  At this point, I import the .stl in a Cura slicing software. This software is where I configure settings specific to 
materials and temperatures required which are based on machine models and whatever print material chosen (i.e. ABS, PLA, PETG, TPU, Wood, etc.)
