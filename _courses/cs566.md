# CS566 - Principles and Practices of Cyber Defense

Graduate-level course focusing on practical cybersecurity defense strategies, attack methodologies, and hands-on security analysis techniques.

## Course Overview

This course provided comprehensive hands-on experience with cybersecurity defense principles, focusing on:
- **Network Security Analysis**: Understanding attack vectors and defensive measures
- **Penetration Testing**: Ethical hacking methodologies and vulnerability assessment
- **Incident Response**: Systematic approach to security breach investigation
- **Defense Strategies**: Multi-layered security architecture and implementation

## Laboratory Work

### Lab 2: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack Analysis
Comprehensive laboratory exercise demonstrating ARP poisoning attacks and defensive countermeasures, providing hands-on experience with network security vulnerabilities.
