# QGIS & Open Data

Using AWS resources, I have been successful serving local map data for streaming access to various requesting clients.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on leveraging open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) tools to create accessible mapping solutions. By combining QGIS with cloud infrastructure, the goal is to democratize access to geospatial data and analysis tools.

## Technologies Used

- **QGIS**: Free and Open Source Geographic Information System
- **AWS**: Cloud infrastructure for hosting and data serving
- **Open Data**: Publicly available geospatial datasets
- **Web Services**: RESTful APIs for data access

## Current Status

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure âœ… Completed
- AWS EC2 instance deployment and configuration
- QGIS Server installation and basic WMS/WFS setup
- Apache web server integration with FastCGI
- SSL certificate implementation for secure connections

### Phase 2: Data Integration ðŸ”„ In Progress
- **Open Data Sources**: Integration with USGS, Census Bureau, and OpenStreetMap
- **Database Optimization**: PostGIS performance tuning for large datasets
- **API Development**: RESTful endpoints for programmatic access
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI specification creation

### Phase 3: Client Applications ðŸ“‹ Planned
- Web-based mapping interface using Leaflet.js
- Mobile application for field data collection
- Desktop GIS plugin for direct QGIS integration
- Python SDK for developers

### Current Metrics
- **Data Volume**: 2.3TB of geospatial datasets served
- **API Requests**: 10,000+ monthly requests
- **Coverage Area**: Continental United States with selected global datasets
- **Update Frequency**: Daily automated synchronization with source APIs
