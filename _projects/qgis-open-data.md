# QGIS & Open Data

Using AWS resources, I have been successful serving local map data for streaming access to various requesting clients.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on leveraging open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) tools to create accessible mapping solutions. By combining QGIS with cloud infrastructure, the goal is to democratize access to geospatial data and analysis tools.

## Technologies Used

- **QGIS**: Free and Open Source Geographic Information System
- **AWS**: Cloud infrastructure for hosting and data serving
- **Open Data**: Publicly available geospatial datasets
- **Web Services**: RESTful APIs for data access

## Current Status

> **Note**: This documentation is a work in progress.

The project is actively being developed with ongoing improvements to:
- Data serving efficiency
- Client accessibility
- Integration with additional data sources
- Performance optimization

## Resources

- [QGIS - A Free and Open Source Geographic Information System](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/)
- Related: [AWS Infrastructure Project](/projects/aws/)

## Future Enhancements

- Enhanced API documentation
- Client SDK development
- Real-time data streaming capabilities
- Mobile client applications
